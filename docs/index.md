Authentication, authorization and access control for PHP
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

Installation
---

Install using composer

    composer require jasny/auth

Usage
---

`Auth` is a composition class. It takes an _authz_, _storage_, and optionally a _confirmation_ service.

```php
use Jasny\Auth\Auth;
use Jasny\Auth\Authz\Levels;

$levels = new Levels(['user' => 1, 'moderator' => 10, 'admin' => 100]);
$auth = new Auth($levels, new AuthStorage()); // See `setup` docs for this class

session_start();
$auth->initialize();

// Later...
if (!$auth->is('admin')) {
    http_response_code(403);
    echo "Access denied";
    exit();
}
```

The `Auth` service isn't usable until it's initialized. This should be done after the session is started.

```php
session_start();
$auth->initialize();
```
